SkyBlock Isles :: A discord bot that displays player stats for a now discontinued server called SkyBlock Isles.
SkyBot Python :: Rewrite of a bot that does pretty much everything (currency, fun commands, levels, music)
SkyBot Rust :: pre-release version of the SkyBot in Python. (Note: Still weeding out some bugs)
SkyBot JS :: Second iteration of a discord bot that does pretty much everything.
